# Advanced Tech Course at the Albany

This repository is a series of files featuring functions and experiments, created as a means of practising and expanding javascript knowledge. Below, find a brief explanation of each file:

## largestNumber.js

The first javascript exploration - this file demonstrates three ways to code a .js file to distinguish the highest number within a group of three. 

It offers a simple introduction to good variable naming practices, a function using the traditional function syntax and a function using arrow syntax. Other noteworthy elements include the use of the logical AND (&&) operator, the use of an if, else if sequence, and concatenation of a string and a variable using backticks. 

## fizzbuzz.js

The first independent challenge. This file demonstrates my working on the FizzBuzz challenge. A function that returns the word “Fizz” when a number is divisible by 3, returns the word “Buzz” when a number is divisible by 5, and returns the word FizzBuzz when divisible by both.

My working identified the need for a for loop, and a set of if, else if statements. My error was not including a return, and an easier method would have been simply printing to the log each time an individual number was passed through the loop.

## fizzbuzzTutorial.js

This file demonstrates the working tutorial of my instructor for the FizzBuzz challenge including a function which uses a for loop and within that, and if, else if statement. The second function demonstrates how to print the list as an array.

Finally, the .js file includes a module export to access the function in another.js file.

## objectDestructuring.js

A file that demonstrates object destructuring, creating properties around a constant variable, creating a function that uses these properties which are then included in a concatenated string and calling the variable to access the properties.

## another.js

An example of object destructuring and module exports the access a .js function from an alternative file.
